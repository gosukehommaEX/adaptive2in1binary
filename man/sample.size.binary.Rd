\description{
This function calculates the required sample size for two-arm superiority
trials with binary endpoints to achieve a target power. It supports five
types of one-sided statistical tests: the Pearson chi-squared test, the
Fisher exact test, the Fisher mid-P test, the Z-pooled exact unconditional
test, and the Boschloo exact unconditional test. The function uses a grid
search algorithm to find the minimum sample size.
}
\details{
The function implements the sample size calculation methodology described in
Homma and Yoshida (20XX). The algorithm starts with an initial sample size
estimate based on the normal approximation for the Pearson chi-squared test,
then uses a grid search to find the exact minimum sample size that achieves
the target power. The exact power is calculated using the \code{power.binary}
function without approximation.

\examples{
# Example 1: Pearson chi-squared test
sample.size.binary(p1 = 0.4, p2 = 0.2, r = 2, alpha = 0.025,
                   tar.power = 0.8, Test = "Chisq")

# Example 2: Fisher exact test
sample.size.binary(p1 = 0.5, p2 = 0.2, r = 3, alpha = 0.025,
                   tar.power = 0.9, Test = "Fisher")

# Example 3: Boschloo exact unconditional test
sample.size.binary(p1 = 0.7, p2 = 0.2, r = 4, alpha = 0.025,
                   tar.power = 0.8, Test = "Boschloo")

# Example 4: Compare sample sizes across different tests
tests <- c("Chisq", "Fisher", "Fisher-midP", "Z-pool", "Boschloo")
results <- lapply(tests, function(test) {
  sample.size.binary(p1 = 0.6, p2 = 0.3, r = 1, alpha = 0.025,
                     tar.power = 0.8, Test = test)
})
