Description: Provides functions to analytically evaluate type I error rate and 
    power for the 2-in-1 adaptive design with binary endpoints. The 2-in-1 design
    allows a trial to maintain a small trial or expand to a large trial adaptively
    based on interim analysis decisions. This package implements exact analytical 
    calculations without Monte Carlo simulations, applicable to various statistical
    tests including chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Boschloo's exact 
    unconditional test.
