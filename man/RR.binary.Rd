\title{Rejection Region for Two-Arm Trials with Binary Endpoints}
\usage{
RR.binary(N1, N2, alpha, Test)
}
\arguments{
\item{N1}{Sample size for group 1 (treatment group).}

\item{N2}{Sample size for group 2 (control group).}

\item{alpha}{One-sided level of significance (e.g., 0.025).}

\item{Test}{Type of statistical test. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item "Chisq": One-sided Pearson chi-squared test
\item "Fisher": Fisher exact test
\item "Fisher-midP": Fisher mid-P test
\item "Z-pool": Z-pooled exact unconditional test
\item "Boschloo": Boschloo exact unconditional test
}}
}
\value{
A matrix of logical values (TRUE/FALSE) of dimension (N1 + 1) x (N2 + 1),
where TRUE indicates that the combination of observed responders (x1, x2)
falls in the rejection region. Rows correspond to the number of responders
in group 1 (0 to N1) and columns correspond to the number of responders
in group 2 (0 to N2).
}
\description{
This function calculates the rejection region for two-arm superiority trials
with binary endpoints. It supports five types of one-sided statistical tests:
the Pearson chi-squared test, the Fisher exact test, the Fisher mid-P test,
the Z-pooled exact unconditional test, and the Boschloo exact unconditional test.
The rejection region is determined based on the specified sample sizes and
significance level.
}
\details{
The function implements the methodology described in Homma and Yoshida (20XX)
for calculating rejection regions in the context of 2-in-1 adaptive designs
with binary endpoints. For the Pearson chi-squared test and Z-pooled test,
the rejection region is based on the standardized test statistic. For Fisher-based
tests, the rejection region is determined using the hypergeometric distribution.
The Boschloo test maximizes the type I error rate over the nuisance parameter
under the null hypothesis to obtain an exact unconditional test.

\examples{
# Example 1: Boschloo exact unconditional test
N1 <- 20
N2 <- 10
alpha <- 0.025
RR <- RR.binary(N1, N2, alpha, Test = "Boschloo")
print(RR)

# Example 2: Fisher exact test
RR_fisher <- RR.binary(N1 = 30, N2 = 30, alpha = 0.025, Test = "Fisher")

# Example 3: Pearson chi-squared test
RR_chisq <- RR.binary(N1 = 40, N2 = 20, alpha = 0.025, Test = "Chisq")
