\arguments{
\item{N11}{Sample size for group 1 at stage 1 (interim analysis).}

\item{N21}{Sample size for group 2 at stage 1 (interim analysis).}

\item{N12}{Sample size for group 1 at stage 2 (Phase 2 part).}

\item{N13}{Sample size for group 1 at stage 3 (Phase 3 part).}

\item{N23}{Sample size for group 2 at stage 3 (Phase 3 part).}

\item{cutpoint}{A cutpoint of the risk difference for the interim decision.
Can be NA (to return results for all possible cutpoints) or a single value
within -1 < cutpoint <= 1.}

\item{alpha2}{One-sided level of significance at satge 2 (e.g., 0.025).}

\item{alpha3}{One-sided level of significance at satge 3 (e.g., 0.025).}

\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{cutpoint}: Cutpoint(s) of the risk difference over x11 (0,...,N11) and x21 (0,...,N21)
\item \code{Test}: Names of the statistical tests (Chisq, Fisher, Fisher-midP, Z-pool, Boschloo)
\item \code{Test.size}: Test size (maximum type I error rate over the entire range of theta)
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the test size (maximum type I error rate) for a
2-in-1 adaptive phase 2/3 design with binary endpoints. The test size is
defined as the maximum type I error rate over the entire range of the
nuisance parameter theta under the composite null hypothesis H0: p1 = p2 = theta.
The function provides results for five types of one-sided statistical tests.
}
\details{
The function implements the test size calculation methodology described in
Homma and Yoshida (20XX) for 2-in-1 adaptive designs with binary endpoints.
While the point null hypothesis assumes H0: p1 = p2 = p for a specific value
of p, the true response probability might differ from p. Therefore, the exact
type I error rate must be evaluated under the composite null hypothesis
H0: p1 = p2 by searching over all possible values of theta in \code{[0, 1]}.

The test size is calculated by:
\enumerate{
\item Computing power under H0 (i.e., p1 = p2) for a grid of theta values
\item Taking the maximum power across all theta values
}

This provides the maximum type I error rate, which can be used to verify
whether the trial controls the type I error rate at the nominal significance level.
